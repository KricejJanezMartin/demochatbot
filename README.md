## Sleep Information Chatbot showcase
This project is a custom ChatBot for Telegram, designed to provide context-based information. The bot is built on the Andrew Huberman Lab podcast, with all episodes indexed for sleep-related knowledge. This unique data source allows the bot to provide valuable insights.

The bot uses LLamaIndex for data processing and Pinecone VectorDB for storing the index, ensuring quick, accurate, and contextually relevant responses. The prompt template can be adjusted for better-designed answers, allowing the bot to be tailored to user needs.

The bot is designed with deployment flexibility. It can be deployed on existing infrastructure or provided by us, offering clients the flexibility to choose the deployment method that best suits their needs. This project stands out due to its unique data source, intelligent response generation, high customization, and flexible deployment options.

You can access the chatbot on Telegram via this [link](https://t.me/SleepHbrChat_bot). Please note, it's currently operational primarily for demonstration purposes, to exhibit its capabilities to potential clients.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the [LlamaIndexCourse](https://github.com/jbergant/LlamaIndexCourse) repository for providing the initial data to create the index based on the Huberman Lab sleep podcasts.
